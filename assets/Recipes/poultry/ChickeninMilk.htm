      <H3>Chicken in Milk</H3>
      <P>Recipe courtesy Jamie Oliver</P><I>A slightly odd, but really fantastic 
      combination, which must be tried</I>
      <P><I>1 (3 pound/ 1.5 kilogram) organic chicken <BR>Salt and freshly 
      ground black pepper <BR>4 ounces (115 grams) or 1 stick butter <BR>1/2 
      cinnamon stick <BR>1 good handful fresh sage, leaves picked <BR>2 lemons, 
      zested<BR>6 garlic cloves, skin left on <BR>1 pint (565 milliliters) 
      milk</I>
      <P>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C/gas 5), and find a 
      snug-fitting pot for the chicken. (from tv show, stuff chicken with the sliced 2 lemons, and the ends of the sage.) Season it generously all over with salt 
      and pepper, and fry it in the butter, turning the chicken to get an even 
      color all over, until golden. Remove from the heat, put the chicken on a 
      plate, and throw away the butter left in the pot. This will leave you with 
      tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan, which will give you a 
      lovely caramel flavor later on. 
      <P>Put your chicken back in the pot with the rest of the ingredients, and 
      cook in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Baste with the cooking juice 
      when you remember. The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a 
      sauce, which is absolutely fantastic. 
      <P>To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide it on to your plates. 
      Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds. Serve with wilted spinach 
      or greens and some mashed potato.
