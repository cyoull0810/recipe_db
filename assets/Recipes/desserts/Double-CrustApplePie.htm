      <P>(c)2002 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. All Rights 
      Reserved</P><I>Perfect Piecrust, recipe follows<BR>1 large egg yolk<BR>1 
      tablespoon heavy cream<BR>3 pounds assorted apples, such as Macoun, Granny 
      Smith, Cortland, Jonagold, and Empire, peeled, cored, and cut into 
      1/4-inch-thick slices<BR>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<BR>1/4 
      cup granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling<BR>3 tablespoons 
      all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough<BR>1 teaspoon ground 
      cinnamon<BR>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<BR>1/8 teaspoon salt<BR>1 
      tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<BR>Best-quality vanilla 
      ice cream (optional)</I>
      <P>On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 disk of piecrust to a 
      1/8-inch-thick circle, about 13 inches in diameter. Drape dough over a 
      9-inch pie pan. Transfer pan to refrigerator, and chill 30 minutes. Heat 
      oven to 425 degrees F. Whisk together the egg yolk and cream; set aside. 
      In a large bowl, toss together the apples, lemon juice, granulated sugar, 
      flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; place in chilled bottom crust. Dot with 
      butter. Roll out the remaining disk of dough. Brush the rim of the bottom 
      crust with the egg wash. Place second piece of dough on top, and trim so 
      1-inch overhangs. Tuck the dough under, and crimp the edges with a fork or 
      your fingers. Transfer pie to the refrigerator, and chill until firm, 
      about 15 minutes. Remove pie from the refrigerator, brush with the egg 
      wash, and sprinkle generously with sugar. Cut 4 vents in the top, allowing 
      the steam to escape. Bake until crust begins to turn light brown, about 25 
      minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake until golden brown and 
      the juices are bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to 
      cool. Serve pie with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
      <P><I>Perfect Piecrust:<BR>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled, plus 
      more for pie plate<BR>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 
      out dough<BR>1 teaspoon salt<BR>1 teaspoon sugar<BR>4 tablespoons ice 
      water, plus more as needed</I>
      <P>Cut each stick of butter into eight pieces, and refrigerate until 
      needed. Place the flour, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl, and mix 
      to combine. Add the chilled butter. Using a pastry blender, incorporate 
      the butter into the flour mixture; the mixture should resemble coarse meal 
      with small pieces of butter, the size of small peas, remaining visible. 
      Drizzle 2 tablespoons ice water over the flour-butter mixture, and blend. 
      Repeat with an additional 2 tablespoons water. At this point, you may have 
      to add more water: When a handful of dough squeezed together just holds 
      its shape, you've added enough; if the dough crumbles, continue 
      incorporating water, 1 tablespoon at a time, checking the consistency 
      after each additional tablespoon. Turn the dough out onto a clean work 
      surface. Divide into to equal pieces, and place on two separate sheets of 
      plastic wrap. Flatten, and form 2 disks. Wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 
      hour. Lightly dust a clean, dry work surface with flour. Place the chilled 
      dough in the center of the work surface, and dust the dough as well as the 
      rolling pin with flour. Position the rolling pin on the center of the 
      disk, and begin rolling the dough away from you. Give the disk a quarter 
      turn, and roll again. Continue turning and rolling until you have an even 
      1/8-inch thickness. Turning the dough as you roll will prevent it from 
      sticking to the work surface. A dry pastry brush is handy to remove any 
      excess flour during and after the rolling process. Lightly butter the pie 
      plate. To minimize stretching when moving the dough, roll it around the 
      pin, lift up, and unroll over the buttered pie plate. Using your fingers, 
      gently pat the dough into place. Trim any excess dough with a paring knife 
      or kitchen shears, leaving a 1-inch overhang; then fold dough under to 
      reinforce the edge. Yield: 2 (8 to 10-inch) crusts
