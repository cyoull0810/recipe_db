for another dish. After separating the eggs, cover the
yolks with plastic wrap, pressing it down on the surface of
the eggs so that a crust will not form while waiting for
the cream to heat.<P>Heat cream with vanilla (usually best if done in a double
boiler). Do not allow to boil. There should be a ring of
bubbles around the edge of the pan when ready. As soon as
the cream has heated, stir the white sugar into the yolks.
Don't add the sugar before because the sugar will "cook"
the raw yolks and ruin the texture of the custard. Stir a
small quantity of the hot cream into the eggs, stirring
constantly, and then add all the cream while continuing to
stir.<P>Strain into an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 dish. Set the custard dish in
another pan and add cool water until it comes halfway up
the outside of the custard dish. Hot water will cause the
custard to become tough on the outside. Bake at 350 degrees
for 35 minutes. Chill for 3 to 4 hours after cooling. Place
brown sugar in a strainer and press through onto the
custard, spreading evenly over the surface. Broil about 4
to 6 inches from the heat source until it begins to glaze,
watching carefully that it doesn't catch fire or burn.
Chill until a crust is formed. Serve very cold (do not
freeze!)</FONT></P></DD></DL></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY>
