    <TD bgColor=#e7e7d4><FONT size=+1><B>Preparation:</B><BR>Prepare dough 
      sponge and proof yeast by mixing yeast, 1/2 cup flour, and 1/2 cup water 
      with 1/2 tsp. honey dissolved in the water in a bowl and letting stand for 
      20 minutes until mixture is foamy. (Throw out and start over with fresher 
      yeast if not foamy.) 
      <P>Mix 1/2 of remaining flour with salt, remaining water with remaining 
      honey dissolved in it, olive oil, and dough sponge. Mix in remaining flour 
      (dough should be slightly sticky and not dry). Knead 15 minutes on a 
      floured surface (10 minutes in a machine) until smooth. Use following Rise 
      Method I or II: 
      <P>Rise Method I (normal): Place dough in lightly oiled bowl and cover 
      with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled (about 1 to 1 1/2 hours) in a 
      warm place. Punch dough down and divide in half. Dust dough portions with 
      flour and put in ziploc bags in the freezer for 30 minutes (stops rising) 
      and then move to refrigerator until ready to use. 
      <P>Rise Method II (refrigerator): Divide dough in half. Dust dough 
      portions with flour and put in ziploc bags in the refrigerator for two 
      days. 
      <P>Remove dough portion from refrigerator when ready to shape into crust. 
      Punch down dough thoroughly and spread/stretch dough portion by hand and 
      roller on a greased pizza pan. Move dough crust to pizza peel spread with 
      coarse cornmeal or to pizza screen. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings and 
      bake in preheated 500° F oven directly on the pizza stone for 8-10 minutes 
      or until crust is golden brown. Cool 2-3 minutes on a wire rack before 
      cutting and serving. 
      <P>This recipe makes 2 13" crusts.</FONT> </P></TD></TR>
