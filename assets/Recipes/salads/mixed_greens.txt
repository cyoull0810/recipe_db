FRESH WILD GREENS
AND MIRLITON SLAW
WITH WARM BACON
VINAIGRETTE

Robert and Ouida Merrifield, chef-owners, Polo Grill,
Tulsa, Okla. Yields 4 salads

The Merrifields advise picking dandelions that grow
under trees and that haven't flowered as they have
a milder taste. They say that polk, a green that is
native to their area, wilt grow as tat[ as a person, so
they advise using the most tender leaves available.
