<H4>TOP 10 RECIPES OF 2001</H4>
<P></P>
<H1>The Best Recipes of 2001</H1>
<H2>From red enchiladas to low-fat Indian fish, it was a very good 
year.</H2><BR>January 2 2002<BR><BR>There is a rhythm to life in the Los Angeles 
Times Test Kitchen. We test between 15 and 20 recipes every week--everything 
that runs in the newspaper. In a year, that's about 800 recipes. Without 
organization and a tight schedule, nothing would ever get done.<BR><BR>Mondays 
and Tuesdays start slow. Ideas are developed and dishes are tinkered with. 
Advance preparations begin for recipes that will be fully tested later in the 
week. Frequently, scouting trips are made for the many props and bits of 
decoration that are used in photographs.<BR><BR>Wednesdays and Thursdays, the 
place is going full-steam. Dishes come out of the testing side of the kitchen 
and go over to the styling side to be made ready for their close-ups. Then 
they're taken next-door to be photographed in our studio. Finally, they're 
brought out to the testing table for the staff to sample. Then the pace 
subsides. Fridays are devoted to more advance testing and to filming the 
two-minute <B><A 
href="http://www.latimes.com/features/food/quickfix/la-quickfix-package.special">"Quick 
Fix"</A></B> videos that appear every week on our Web site.<BR><BR>But every 
once in a while, this rhythm is broken. A computer message pops up: "You've got 
to come try this!" A parade of staffers goes streaming into the kitchen. 
Everything stops while all involved--writers, cooks, editors and 
photographers--gather around to taste something really great.<BR><BR>Then they 
run back to their desks to make notes. Because we all know that at the end of 
the year there will be a test. That's when we vote for our best recipes of the 
year.<BR><BR>It could be anything. Because of the variety of stories and recipes 
we offer, it could be a perfect Californio red enchilada or a sublime chocolate 
truffle cake from a famous restaurant. It could be a variation on a Cuban rice 
dish that takes less than 30 minutes to prepare or an Indian-style sauce for 
grilled fish that offers remarkably complex flavors at 4 grams of fat per 
serving.<BR><BR>The goal of the Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen is not to provide 
the staff with delicious snacks--it's to ensure that every recipe we publish 
works. But sometimes we exceed even our own expectations.<BR><BR><B>Classic Red 
Enchiladas</B><BR><BR>Active Work Time: 35 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation 
Time: 1 hour<BR><BR>Vegetarian<BR><BR>This recipe comes from an Oct. 24 cover 
story by Jacqueline Higuera McMahan, who wrote "Rancho Cooking, Mexican and 
Californian Recipes" (Sasquatch Books, $21.95). She says the red enchilada 
symbolizes the fusion of native Mexican foods with some of the favored 
ingredients brought over from Spain such as olives, olive oil and cheeses. In 
her family, these enchiladas, done Californio-style, with flour tortillas rather 
than corn, were served at every important event but especially at barbecues. Try 
to make the enchiladas the day before you need them because the red chiles will 
soak into the tortillas and make the enchiladas even better. Buy the thinnest 
tortillas you can find or use homemade.<BR><BR>Olive oil<BR><BR>5 onions, 
chopped<BR><BR>Salt, pepper<BR><BR>1 tablespoon dried oregano<BR><BR>4 cups Red 
Chile Sauce, divided<BR><BR>10 flour tortillas<BR><BR>1 1/2 pounds medium-sharp 
Cheddar cheese, grated<BR><BR>1 cup pitted black olives or home-cured 
olives<BR><BR>Oil 2 (15x10-inch) jellyroll pans.<BR><BR>Heat 3 tablespoons of 
olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add the onions; cook, stirring 
frequently, until softened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to 
taste and the oregano.<BR><BR>Spoon 1 cup of Red Chile Sauce onto a wide dinner 
plate. Starting with 1 tortilla, dip both sides in the sauce. Place 1/2 cup of 
grated cheese, 2 olives and 1/3 cup of cooked onions down the middle of the 
tortilla. (We never added grated hard-boiled eggs, but many rancho families 
did.) Lastly, roll the sides of each tortilla over the filling. Place the 
enchilada, folded side down, on one of the pans. Repeat with the remaining 
tortillas. Pour the remaining Red Chile Sauce over the enchiladas. Sprinkle the 
remaining cheese in a strip down the middle of each enchilada. Decorate with any 
remaining olives. Cover the pans and refrigerate the enchiladas until you are 
ready to bake them. Let them stand at room temperature 1 hour before 
baking.<BR><BR>Heat the oven to 350 degrees near serving time.<BR><BR>Bake the 
enchiladas until they are puffed and the cheese has melted, 20 to 25 
minutes.<BR><BR>10 enchiladas. Each enchilada: 458 calories; 885 mg sodium; 57 
mg cholesterol; 30 grams fat; 13 grams saturated fat; 31 grams carbohydrates; 18 
grams protein; 4.74 grams fiber.<BR><BR><B>Red Chile Sauce</B><BR><BR>Active 
Work Time: 20 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours<BR><BR>Red 
Chile Sauce, the pride of the kitchen, was used not only for the famous red 
enchiladas but countless other favorites such as Chile Colorado and tamales. 
This sauce differentiates itself by the toasted flour roux used to deepen 
flavors and the tiny bit of vinegar used to "sweeten" the chile.<BR><BR>18 dried 
California or New Mexican chiles, or a combination of both<BR><BR>2 ancho 
chiles<BR><BR>3 cloves garlic<BR><BR>3 1/2 cups water, divided<BR><BR>3 
tablespoons light-flavored olive oil<BR><BR>2 tablespoons flour<BR><BR>1 1/2 
teaspoons ground oregano<BR><BR>1 tablespoon cider vinegar<BR><BR>1 teaspoon 
salt<BR><BR>Dash sugar, if necessary<BR><BR>1/2 to 1 cup water or mild chicken 
broth, to thin sauce<BR><BR>Hold the California and ancho chiles under running 
water to rinse. Use scissors to cut off the chiles' stems and cut the chiles in 
half. Shake out the seeds onto a paper towel. (Put the seeds in your garden for 
the birds. Place the chiles and garlic in the top half of a steamer set over 
simmering water. Steam for 25 minutes. This technique, as opposed to soaking 
dried chiles in boiling water, preserves more of the chile flavor.<BR><BR>Remove 
the chiles from the heat. Place 1/3 of the chiles in a blender with 1 cup of 
water. Puree until smooth. Pour the puree into a wire strainer nested over a 
large bowl. Continue pureeing the rest of the chiles, garlic and water as in the 
previous step, in batches, so that you add 1/3 of the chiles each time. Push all 
of the chile puree through the strainer using a spatula or wooden spoon. Be sure 
to scrape off the chile puree clinging to the bottom of the strainer. Pour the 
remaining water into the blender and turn it on to help clean the blades. Pour 
this chile water through the strainer to catch the last bit of goodness. You 
should now have about 3 1/2 cups chile puree.<BR><BR>Heat the olive oil in a 
deep skillet over medium heat and add the flour, toasting lightly until light 
nut brown, stirring, 4 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the chile puree and add the 
oregano, vinegar and salt. Simmer the sauce for 20 minutes to blend flavors. 
Taste, and if the sauce seems a bit sharp, add sugar. If the sauce seems thick, 
add water or broth, simmering again for about 5 minutes.<BR><BR>About 3 to 4 
cups. Each 1/4 cup: 33 calories; 165 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 3 grams fat; 0

20 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours plus 3 hours 
standing<BR><BR>Some jams are all about capturing the freshness of a fruit's 
flavor. This recipe from local preserve maker Edon Waycott, which ran July 11, 
takes advantage of the extra complexity that comes with long cooking. Starting 
your day with a spoonful of this jam would be luxury indeed.<BR><BR>3 to 4 
quarts fresh strawberries, about 12 pint baskets<BR><BR>2 cups sugar, or to 
taste<BR><BR>3 tablespoons lemon or lime juice<BR><BR>Lightly rinse the berries 
without submerging them in water. Remove the hulls, leaving the berries whole. 
Combine the berries, sugar and juice in a non-aluminum bowl. Allow them to 
macerate at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for at least 3 to 4 hours. 
The mixture can be covered and refrigerated overnight at this point.<BR><BR>Pour 
the mixture into a wide, shallow 6- to 8-quart saucepan and set the pan over 
high heat. Bring to a boil, skim the foam that collects on the surface, then 
reduce the heat to low. Make sure bubbles continue to break the surface. After 
about 20 minutes, the berries will give up additional juices and appear to be 
floating. Continue cooking them, stirring more often, and skimming the foam for 
about 1 hour.<BR><BR>The jam is almost done when it turns dark red and the ratio 
of berries to juice is about equal. Watch and stir the jam often. Refrigerate 
and use within several days, or can in the usual way.<BR><BR>5 (8-ounce) jars. 
Each tablespoon: 27 calories; 0 sodium; 0 cholesterol; 0 fat; 0 saturated fat; 7 
grams carbohydrates; 0 protein; 0.61 gram fiber.<BR><BR><B>Rhubarb and Raspberry 
Ice</B><BR><BR>Active Work Time: 10 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 40 
minutes plus chilling<BR><BR>There are times when you want a dessert that's 
drop-dead decadent (see the Peanut Butter Cream Pie and Chocolate Truffle Cake). 
But most of the time what you're looking for is something that's a little sweet, 
with complex flavors, but won't leave you feeling like lead. This vibrantly 
flavored ice from Donna Deane's April 8 "The Lighter Side" column was one of our 
favorite desserts this year, and it has only 143 calories, without any 
fat.<BR><BR>1 cup sugar<BR><BR>4 cups water<BR><BR>4 cups rhubarb cut into 
1-inch pieces<BR><BR>1/2 cup raspberry-flavored vodka<BR><BR>2 tablespoons lime 
juice<BR><BR>Mint leaves and raspberries, for garnish<BR><BR>Combine the sugar 
and water in a 3-quart saucepan and bring it to a boil. Add the rhubarb. Return 
to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the rhubarb is soft and falling 
apart, about 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate 
overnight.<BR><BR>Strain the pulp and discard it. Combine the rhubarb syrup with 
the vodka and lime juice.<BR><BR>Freeze the mixture in an ice cream maker 
according to the manufacturer's directions. Spoon the ice into a chilled loaf 
dish. Cover and freeze until ready to serve. Spoon the ice into serving glasses 
and garnish each with some mint leaves and a few raspberries.<BR><BR>8 servings. 
Each serving: 143 calories; 3 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 0 fat; 0 saturated fat; 
28 grams carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.44 gram fiber.<BR><BR><B>Arroz con 
Chorizo y Camarones</B><BR><BR>Active Work Time: 10 minutes<BR><BR>Total 
Preparation Time: 30 minutes<BR><BR>This Aug. 15 <B><A 
href="http://www.latimes.com/features/food/quickfix/la-quickfix-package.special">"Quick 
Fix"</A></B> recipe by Times Test Kitchen assistant Mayi Brady was one of the 
most popular we ran all year. Go figure: It's homey, filling and delicious. And 
you can make it in 30 minutes. The only way it could be better is if it made you 
younger or thinner.<BR><BR>1 large onion, chopped<BR><BR>4 cloves garlic, 
minced<BR><BR>1 red bell pepper, chopped<BR><BR>1 green bell pepper, 
chopped<BR><BR>1 large tomato, chopped<BR><BR>1 cup rice<BR><BR>3/4 pound 
Spanish chorizo or linguica, casing removed, cut into 1/4-inch slices<BR><BR>2 
cups chicken broth<BR><BR>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined<BR><BR>2 
tablespoons chopped parsley<BR><BR>Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium 
heat. Add the onion, garlic and red and green peppers. Cook, stirring, until the 
onion and peppers start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato and rice and 
cook another 2 to 3 minutes until the tomato softens.<BR><BR>Stir in the chorizo 
and the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer 
until the rice is tender but still quite moist, about 15 minutes.<BR><BR>Stir in 
the shrimp, cover the pan and cook until the shrimp are opaque and pink, 2 to 3 
minutes. Stir in the parsley and serve.<BR><BR>4 servings. Each serving: 583 
calories; 1,314 mg sodium; 243 mg cholesterol; 31 grams fat; 10 grams saturated 
fat; 34 grams carbohydrates; 40 grams protein; 2.88 grams 
fiber.<BR><BR><B>Chocolate Truffle Cake</B><BR><BR>Active Work Time: 25 
minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes plus 1 hour 
chilling<BR><BR>This recipe from French Laundry chef Thomas Keller's March 7 
"Professional Help" column is almost more of a molten-centered chocolate souffle 
than a cake. The batter can be prepared up to 1 hour ahead and left at room 
temperature to be baked at the last minute. Or you can make it even more in 
advance, freeze it, then pop it straight into the oven. The baking time in that 
case will increase to 20 minutes.<BR><BR>GANACHE<BR><BR>2 ounces semisweet 
chocolate<BR><BR>1/4 cup whipping cream<BR><BR>Grate the chocolate and place it 
in a bowl. Bring the whipping cream just to a boil and pour it over the 
chocolate. Slowly stir until smooth. Transfer the mixture into a shallow glass 
dish and let it cool slightly, about 10 minutes, then place it in the freezer to 
chill, 1 hour.<BR><BR>Scoop out 5 balls using a 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon and 
shape them so they're round. Chill until ready to use.<BR><BR>CAKE<BR><BR>14 
ounces bittersweet chocolate<BR><BR>1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter<BR><BR>1 
tablespoon flour<BR><BR>10 egg yolks<BR><BR>7 tablespoons sugar<BR><BR>Nonstick 
cooking spray<BR><BR>Powdered sugar, for dusting<BR><BR>Heat the oven to 375 
degrees.<BR><BR>Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler set 
over, but not touching, simmering water. Stir in the flour and remove from the 
heat to cool slightly.<BR><BR>Whip the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer 
and slowly add the sugar until the whisk leaves a thick ribbon that stays on top 
of the batter when it is lifted out, about 5 minutes. Pour the chocolate into 
the yolk-sugar mixture and gently fold them together.<BR><BR>Spray 10 (1/2-cup) 
ramekins with cooking spray. Half-fill each with chocolate batter, place 1 
ganache ball in the center and then continue filling to the top with more 
batter. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet. (The recipe can be made 
ahead to this point up to 1 hour in advance and stored at room temperature, or 1 
week in advance and frozen, tightly covered.)<BR><BR>Bake the cakes until they 
begin to pull away from the sides of the ramekins, 13 to 15 minutes. Dust with 
powdered sugar.<BR><BR>10 servings. Each serving: 530 calories; 248 mg sodium; 
287 mg cholesterol; 43 grams fat; 25 grams saturated fat; 38 grams 
carbohydrates; 5 grams protein; 2.69 grams fiber.<BR><BR><B>Hazelnut 
Crisps</B><BR><BR>Active Work Time: 30 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 45 
minutes plus 1 hour chilling<BR><BR>This is the second year in a row that 
well-known cookbook author Deborah Madison has placed a recipe on our top 10. 
From a Jan. 31 story praising hazelnuts comes this definitive simple nut cookie: 
fragile, crisp and very good.<BR><BR>1 cup toasted hazelnuts<BR><BR>1 tablespoon 
granulated sugar<BR><BR>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter<BR><BR>1/2 cup brown 
sugar, packed<BR><BR>1/4 teaspoon salt<BR><BR>1 teaspoon vanilla 
extract<BR><BR>1 egg yolk<BR><BR>1 1/4 cups flour<BR><BR>Grind or pulse the 
hazelnuts with the granulated sugar in a food processor until fine, but with a 
few chunks scattered throughout.<BR><BR>Cream the butter and brown sugar with 
the salt until light and fluffy, then stir in the vanilla and egg yolk. Stir in 
the hazelnuts and the flour.<BR><BR>Shape the dough into a rough log, wrap it in 
wax paper or plastic wrap, then run the dough between your thumb and forefinger 
to force it into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Keep it round, or 
square the sides. Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 1 hour, preferably 
longer.<BR><BR>Heat the oven to 350 degrees.<BR><BR>Cut the log into 1/3- to 
1/4-inch thick slices and place them on 2 baking sheets, leaving at least 2 
inches between each piece. Bake until lightly browned on top, about 15 minutes. 
Remove the crisps to a rack to cool; they'll get crispier.<BR><BR>About 27 
crisps. Each crisp: 98 calories; 24 mg sodium; 17 mg cholesterol; 6 grams fat; 2 
grams saturated fat; 10 grams carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.57 gram 
fiber.<BR><BR><B>Grilled Halibut With Indian-Spiced Cauliflower 
Puree</B><BR><BR>Active Work Time: 15 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 45 
minutes<BR><BR>Deep flavors and luscious textures don't necessarily mean food 
that's high in fat. Times Test Kitchen director Donna Deane coated fish with 
tandoori spicing and turned some normally humble vegetables into a complex 
Indian style stew for her "The Lighter Side Column" on Aug. 1. The result is a 
main course that delivers big-time taste despite having only 4 grams of 
fat.<BR><BR>4 (5-ounce) halibut filets<BR><BR>2 tablespoons tandoori 
paste<BR><BR>Nonstick cooking spray<BR><BR>1 onion, chopped<BR><BR>2 cloves 
garlic, sliced<BR><BR>1 tablespoon minced ginger root<BR><BR>1/2 head 
cauliflower, broken into florets (about 1/2 pound)<BR><BR>1 small white boiling 
potato, peeled and cubed<BR><BR>1 cup water<BR><BR>1/4 teaspoon ground 
cumin<BR><BR>1/4 teaspoon ground coriander<BR><BR>1/4 teaspoon ground 
turmeric<BR><BR>1 teaspoon salt<BR><BR>2 teaspoons lime 
juice<BR><BR>Salt<BR><BR>Cilantro sprigs, lime wedges, for garnish<BR><BR>Place 
the fish filets in a shallow glass dish. Spread the tandoori paste over all 
sides. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate while preparing the cauliflower 
puree.<BR><BR>Spray a skillet with nonstick spray. Cook the onion and garlic, 
covered, over medium-low heat until the onion is tender, about 10 minutes, 
stirring occasionally.<BR><BR>Add the ginger, cauliflower, potato and water. 
Bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 
minutes.<BR><BR>Puree the vegetables in a blender until smooth. Blend in the 
cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt and lime juice. Keep the puree 
warm.<BR><BR>Lightly spray both sides of the filets with nonstick spray. Grill 
the sea bass over hot coals or use an indoor grill pan until the fish flakes 
easily with a fork, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Lightly season with salt 
after turning the fish over.<BR><BR>Serve with the cauliflower puree and garnish 
with the cilantro and lime wedges.<BR><BR>4 servings. Each serving: 214 
calories; 1,049 mg sodium; 68 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 
12 grams carbohydrates; 31 grams protein; 2.60 grams fiber.<BR><BR><B>Heirloom 
Tomato Risotto</B><BR><BR>Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 50 
minutes<BR><BR>Vegetarian<BR><BR>Ojai cook Anna Thomas, a screenwriter ("El 
Norte" and "Mi Familia") and cookbook author ("The Vegetarian Epicure"), came up 
with this risotto for an Oct. 10 story on the very Californian pleasures of 
cooking close to home. She makes this risotto with tomatoes grown by the farmer 
who lives just down the hill from her house. Really, it's a fairly 
straightforward dish--the technique is that of any good risotto. The secret of 
this dish is finding the right tomatoes--a combination of several varieties 
works best, but the most important thing is to make sure they are really ripe 
and flavorful. Then be careful not to overcook them. The swirl of bright tomato 
colors against the pale rice is what makes this risotto so beautiful.<BR><BR>2 
1/2 to 3 pounds tomatoes, preferably heirloom varieties<BR><BR>3 1/2 tablespoons 
olive oil, divided<BR><BR>2 cloves garlic, minced<BR><BR>Salt<BR><BR>1 onion, 
chopped<BR><BR>7 to 8 cups vegetable broth<BR><BR>2 1/2 cups Arborio 
rice<BR><BR>1/2 cup dry white wine<BR><BR>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil 
leaves<BR><BR>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for 
serving<BR><BR>Pepper<BR><BR>Bring a pot of water to boil. Cut a shallow "x" in 
the bottom of each tomato and place the tomatoes in the water. Cook 30 seconds, 
remove and rinse under cold water. Peel the tomatoes with a tip of a knife. Core 
the tomatoes and cut them in large wedges or 11/2-inch chunks, preserving their 
juice.<BR><BR>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium 
heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and 
some salt and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring only once or twice.<BR><BR>In 
a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 11/2 tablespoons of olive oil over 
medium heat and cook the onion with a dash of salt until it begins to turn 
golden, 5 to 6 minutes. In another saucepan, heat the vegetable broth to just 
below a simmer and keep it hot.<BR><BR>Add the rice to the onion and stir it 
gently for 2 or 3 minutes. Pour in the wine and stir immediately as it is 
absorbed.<BR><BR>Add a soup ladle of hot broth to the rice and stir with a 
wooden spoon (so you don't ruin your pan), keeping the mixture just at a simmer. 
When the broth is nearly absorbed, add another ladleful and keep stirring. 
Continue this way, adding the broth a bit at a time and stirring almost 
constantly. After about 15 minutes, add the cooked tomatoes with their juice and 
stir until the juice is nearly absorbed, then continue adding broth as before 
until the rice is al dente. This process will take about 25 minutes, and at the 
end you will have a creamy sauce around rice grains that are tender but firm and 
studded with brightly colored pieces of tomato.<BR><BR>Remove from the heat, 
stir in the basil and the Parmesan cheese, taste, adjust the salt and add pepper 
if desired. Add a last ladle of broth, give a final stir and spoon the risotto 
into bowls. Pass the additional Parmesan cheese at the table.<BR><BR>6 to 8

Time: 25 minutes<BR><BR>Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 15 minutes<BR><BR>Times 
Test Kitchen intern Mary Ellen Rae thought up these stuffed eggs for an April 11 
story on an Easter buffet. They're best the day they're made. If that is 
impossible, you can make them a day ahead, up to the point of piping the filling 
into the eggs. Just keep everything refrigerated, and press plastic wrap 
directly onto the surface of the yolk mixture to keep it fresh. Then fill the 
eggs just before serving.<BR><BR>12 eggs<BR><BR>8 sun-dried tomatoes (not in 
oil)<BR><BR>2 tablespoons capers, drained and chopped<BR><BR>1 large shallot, 
finely minced<BR><BR>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<BR><BR>1/2 cup 
mayonnaise<BR><BR>4 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil, divided<BR><BR>Place 
the 12 eggs in a large saucepan. Fill with cool water. Bring the water to boil 
over medium heat. As soon as it boils, reduce the heat to simmer and cook the 
eggs 20 minutes. Fill a bowl with ice cubes and cold water and set 
aside.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, place the sun-dried tomatoes in a microwave-safe bowl 
and cover them with water. Microwave for 2 minutes, then let the tomatoes sit 
several minutes until they have softened. Drain on paper towels, then finely 
mince.<BR><BR>When the eggs are cooked, lift them from the pan using a slotted 
spoon and place them in the cold water. Chill completely, then peel and slice 
them in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and push them through a potato ricer 
or a mesh strainer to break them up into small pieces. This will help make a 
smoother mixture.<BR><BR>Combine the yolks, tomatoes, capers, shallot, mustard, 
mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons of basil in a small bowl. Stir to 
combine.<BR><BR>If the egg whites are inclined to roll around on a plate, cut a 
very thin slice off the bottom. Fill a pastry bag fitted with the star tip with 
the egg yolk mixture. Pipe the filling into the egg whites, then garnish the 
eggs with the remaining basil. If you don't have a pastry bag, you can cut the 
tip off a resealable bag to pipe in the filling, or use a teaspoon. Cover the 
eggs with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.<BR><BR>24 eggs.
