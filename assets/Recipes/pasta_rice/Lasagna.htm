      lasagna sheets, cooked al dente <BR>2 packages (10 ounces each) frozen

      <BR>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan </SPAN>
      <P></P><SPAN class=bodytext>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 
      <P>Bechamel sauce: <BR>In a 2-quart pot, melt 5 tablespoons of butter over 
      medium heat. When butter has completely melted, add the flour and whisk 
      until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly 
      to prevent any lumps from forming. Continue to simmer and whisk over 
      medium heat until the sauce is thick, smooth and creamy, about 10 minutes. 
      The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon. Remove 
      from heat and add the nutmeg and tomato sauce. Stir until well combined 
      and check for seasoning. Set aside and allow to cool completely. 
      <P>In a saute pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil. When almost smoking, add 
      the ground beef and season with salt and pepper. Brown meat, breaking any 
      large lumps, until it is no longer pink. Remove from heat and drain any 
      excess fat. Set aside and allow to cool completely. 
      <P>In a medium sized bowl, thoroughly mix the ricotta and eggs. Season 
      with salt and pepper. Set aside. 
      <P>Into the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, spread 1/3 of the 
      bechamel sauce. Arrange the pasta sheets side by side, covering the bottom 
      of the baking dish. Evenly spread a layer of all the ricotta mixture and 
      then a layer of all the spinach. Arrange another layer of pasta sheets and 
      spread all the ground beef on top. Sprinkle 1/2 the mozzarella cheese on 
      top of the beef. Spread another 1/3 of the bechamel sauce. Arrange the 
      final layer of pasta sheets and top with remaining bechamel, mozzarella 
      and Parmesan cheeses. Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into 
      1/4-inch cubes and top lasagna. 
      <P>Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place lasagna dish on 
      top, cover and put on the middle rack of the oven and bake until top is 
      bubbling, about 30 minutes. Remove cover and continue to bake for about 15 
      minutes.</SPAN>
      <P></P><SPAN class=bodytext>Simple Tomato Sauce: <BR>1/2 cup extra-virgin 
      olive oil <BR>1 small onion, chopped <BR>2 cloves garlic, chopped <BR>1 
      stalk celery, chopped <BR>1 carrot, chopped <BR>Sea salt and freshly 
      ground black pepper <BR>2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes <BR>2 dried bay 
      leaves <BR>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional 
      <P>In a large casserole pot or Dutch over, heat oil over medium high heat. 
      Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 
      minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute 
      until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and 
      bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. 
      Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, 
      add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors. 
      <P>Add 1/2 the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process 
      until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. 
      <P>If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 
      cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months.
