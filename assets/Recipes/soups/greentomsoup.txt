Recipe is copyright by Ben Baker of Magnolia Grill, 1993

1/2 cup vegetable oil
5 ounces country ham, julienned
2 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced
6 whole peeled cloves garlic
2 bay leaves
2 jolopenos, stemmed and sliced
4 green anaheims
2 green pasilla chilies
3 1/2 pound firm, green tomatoes, cored and cut into eighths
1 1/2 quarts chicken stock
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons hot sauce
Salt
1 pound lump crab meat, picked over for cartilage
1 1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
6 tablespoons capers
1/2 cup chopped green onions

In a large saucepan, heat the oil. When the oil is hot, add the ham, 
pan-fry until crispy and golden, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan
from the heat and strain, reserving the oil and ham. Return the oil to the 
pan and heat. Add the onions and saute until soft, about 3 to
4 minutes. Season the onions with salt and pepper. Add the garlic, bay 
leaves and chilies, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes
and stock. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil and 
reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes or until the tomatoes
soften. Remove the bay leaves. Using a handheld blender, puree the soup 
until smooth. Chill the soup. Add the lemon juice and hot
sauce. Season with salt. In a mixing bowl, mix the crab meat, sour cream, 
tomatoes, capers and green onions together. Season the
salad with salt and pepper. To serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls 
and garnish with the crab salad and crispy ham. The soup
can be served either chilled or warm.
